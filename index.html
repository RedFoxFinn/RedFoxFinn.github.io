    <p>I might have said it.. And I guess it is true. Even tho it is something that requires some technical and scientific skills, you have to have some eye for structuring the code (which should also work, of course) so it would be readable by others.</p>
    <p>Technically, if you write the code just for yourself and never intend to give or show it to others, then you probably could (and might) structure it any way you like it. But in my opinion, good code is always written like you would write it to someone else. You might watch the structure of code yourself after a long time and wonder "What did I think of?" if you don't understand it. (Something you might think even if you did.. but that's completely other thing :)</p>

    <p class="intend">So... Who am I?</p>
    <p>I am someone some people would call a <i title="One who works with, or has an interest in, technology or computers">techie</i>.</p>
    <p>I do have some experience and knowledge of different industries but mainly I have focus on sciences and technologies. Additionally I have a bit of background on associations.</p>
    <p>On the field of music I do love rock and metal but have been successfully introduced to the electronic music too (the good part of it).</p>
    <p>Photography is one of my hobbies I like most. And hiking/trekking.</p>
    <p>But most recently I have become a computer science student in a university. I have set my goal to complete not just the bachelor's degree but also the master's degree. For me the change is huge: from <i>just</i> a techie to real academic scholar. Wish me luck :)</p>
